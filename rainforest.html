    <h2>Rainforest Trees</h2>
    <p>The rainforest has four layers. <br>
        The emergent layer is made up of the very tallest trees that rise higher than the rest of the forest. <br>
        In the next layer, the canopy, the leaves and branches of the trees all touch one another or are connected by vines.<br> 
        Most animals in the rainforest live in the canopy. The layer below the canopy is called the understory. <br>
        Small trees and plants that do not need much light grow here. <br>
        The last layer is the forest floor where only a few plants grow because it’s so dark. <br>
    
        Many kinds of plants grow in rainforests. Lianas are thick, woody vines that grow up the trees. <BR>
         When these vines get to the top of the trees, they spread to other trees and form a network of vines over the forest below. <br>
         Orchids, bamboo, and bromeliads are other rainforest plants.
        <br>
        More than half of the world’s animals live in the rainforest. Vampire bats and anacondas live in the rainforests of South America. <br>
        Bengal tigers and orangutans live in Asia’s rainforests, and chimpanzees live in the rainforests of Africa. <br>
        Lots of smaller animals live in rainforests too, including dragonflies, tree frogs, and at least hundreds of species of ants. <br>
        Many of the plants and animals in the rainforest haven’t even been discovered yet!
