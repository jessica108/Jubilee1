      <img src="jess.jpg" width="200" height="400"  alt=""> <br><br> <br>I am student at USF pursing a M.S. in Learning Design and Technology. I recieved my B.A. in Elementary Education in 2012. I have been teaching 2nd grade for the last 10 years. I am married and have an 11 year old daughter. 
       <br> I have some basic knowledge in HTML and CSS but will be learning Java Script. I will be using Visual Studio Code and Githubfor all my pages. 
       <br> 
       <br>
       <br> The week 1 assignment is to add CSS to my page, and make revisions to week 0 homework based on feedback. I added a border at the top, changed my heading font, and added a visual elemement. 
       <br> I adjusted the location of my text to eliminate extra white space.
