    <h2>CSS Layout Float</h2>
<p>In this example, we have created a header, two columns/boxes and a footer. On smaller screens, the columns will stack on top of each other.</p>
<p>Resize the browser window to see the responsive effect (you will learn more about this in our next chapter - HTML Responsive.)</p>

    1 <– = 1 + 0 <br>
    2 <– = 1 + 1 <br>
    3 <– = 2 + 1 <br>
    5 <– = 3 + 2 <br>
    8 <– = 5 + 3 <br>
    13 <– = 8 + 5 <br>
    21 <– = 13 + 8 <br>
    34 <– = 21 + 13</p>i>
